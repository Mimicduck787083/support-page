# Guild System
The purpose of the guild system is to assist you in team cooperation to compete with others. Guilds can also help you find new friends in the Venity Network community.

## Creating a Guild
To create a guild, use the command `/guild` (make sure you leave any guild if you're currently a member to create a new one). Click the "Create Guild" button.

Here is the information needed to create a guild:
- **Guild Name:** Only letters and numbers are allowed, with a minimum of 3 characters and a maximum of 15 characters.
- **Guild Tag:** Only capital letters and numbers are allowed, with a maximum of 6 characters. The guild tag will appear next to your nickname when you're in the lobby.

## Inviting Players to the Guild
To invite players to your guild, use the command `/guild` (make sure you're an officer or leader in your guild). Click the "Invite player" button, then select the player you want to invite to your guild. The list of players displayed will only include those in the same lobby/server.

## How Guild Levels Work
Guild level is calculated based on the amount of GEXP (Guild Experience) the guild has. GEXP is generated from each guild member earning EXP. GEXP increases from EXP multiplied by 1.25 or added by 25%.

Example:
- Player 1 earns 100 EXP and 125 GEXP.

## Maximum Number of Guild Members

The maximum number of guild members can increase based on the guild level.

| Guild Level | Max. Members |
|-------------|--------------|
| 1-9         | 10           |
| 10-19       | 15           | 
| 20-34       | 20           |

| 100-149     | 45           | 
| â‰¥ 150       | 50           |

## Guild Tag Colors
Guild tag colors will appear to the right of your nickname when you're in the lobby. Guilds need to reach a certain level to use specific guild tag colors.

Only officers and leaders can change guild tag colors. To do so, type the command `/guild` and click the "Change tag color" button.

## What is MOTD?
MOTD stands for message of the day, which is a message that appears when guild members join the server.
